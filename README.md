# Square-Stacker-AI
Python game emulator and AI algorithms to play the game Square Stacker from Coolmath Games  

### Description
The objective of Square Stacker is to place randomly-generated multi-colored tiles onto a grid to clear colors and score points. The highly-stochastic nature of the game makes it an ideal testing ground for novel AI algorithms. This project investigates multiple algorithms to play this game, including Deep-Q Networks and search algorithms. For more information, see the IEEE manuscript (Project_Report.pdf).
